This was one of my favorite projects! There were a lot of challenging parts to this one, for example, figuring out when somebody's won diagonally. I wanted to make it as accessible as possible, so the game is fully playable using the keyboard. If I had more time, I would like to make if fully playable using a screen reader and voice commands. Styling it was extremely rewarding, when it all came together in the end.

* Game logic for moving the pieces and determining when a win has occured using jQuery
* Intuitive UX with CSS animations
* Strong focus on accessibility
* Dark mode in localstorage
