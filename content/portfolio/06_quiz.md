This is a response to when I was reading the book, but didn't want to have to carry around a pencil and paper at all times to answer the questions. In transforming it into a web site, users can not only answer the questions a lot more efficiently, but could potentially create a completely different set of answers in different periods of time and go back, seeing how they answered it for example a year ago versus now.

- A Node Express backend
- Utilizing Node's core "fs"-module, user information gets stored in server side JSON files
- Users can browse different chapters
- Strictly translating the cover, text and overall layout of the original book with CSS
